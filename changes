Version: ???

    * add PiwikTracker usage in hookActionCartSave(), to handle updates/creation 
    - off shopping carts in piwik, this eliminates the need to reload the page
    - **NOTE** PiwikTracker is not included in any release but have to be added 
    -          seperatly by you or your developer, after this to use the 

    * moved all settings into class PiwikAnalyticsjsConfiguration
    - the class handles all related to the configuration
    - get, update, validate etc..

    * add setApiUrl

    * added admin option to set cookie 'Path' and 'Name Prefix'

    * added option to enable link tracking, set link tracking classes
    - link tracking was hardcoded before now it can be managed from admin

    * added tracker option discardHashTag

    * added lookup token

    * CLOSE issue: #20

    ** tested with various Piwik versions minimum FULLY supported version is '2.7.0'
     - Absolute minimum Piwik version '2.0.0', but lower than '2.7.0' you will loose
     - functionality

    * add Piwik loaded event thingy
    - see views/templates/hook/jstracking.tpl for details

    * use 'addcslashes' on product catetegories when used for javascript
    - see https://github.com/cmjnisse/piwikanalyticsjs-prestashop/pull/21

    * removed pkapicall ajax handler, not needed any more
    
    * added a check in some places to see if debug is enabled before converting data
    - this saves some memory, and a microsecond or two 

    * removed the possibility to edit other piwik sites from within the module
    - now only the site isset from configuration can be edited

    * Create new layout to keep the same style throughout prestashop versions 1.5.x.x - 1.7.x.x
    - this is done to better make a manual/guide of how to use this module without the need 
    - for multiple versions for each prestashop release

    * WIZARD: if Piwik host is saved with https: prefix set use HTTPS

    * change default product id v3 from {ID}#{ATTRID} to {ID}-{ATTRID} so it folllows the layout of product id v1

    * better validation of some inputs

    * FIX: allow token overide (skip missing error)
    - this introduced new issue with addNew site method, for now we just mix the 
    - Wizzard and Piwik helper classes in that method (this is temporary)

    - only for Prestashop 1.6.0.4 and up.

    * fixed var $this->_errors, must be an array
